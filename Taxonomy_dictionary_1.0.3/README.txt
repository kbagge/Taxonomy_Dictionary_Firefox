The Taxonomy Dictionary

Version 1.0.3: 28th January 2023

The purpose of this dictionary is to include all taxa, so that it can be used from your preferred text editor and correct your spelling mistakes. It should be of good use to anyone working with biology and frequently using taxonomic names in their writing. It will not check if italics is used properly, so please be aware of that yourself. It has been built from the following sources:

- Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Backbone Taxonomy
- Catalogue of Life (COL)
- International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)
- List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN)
- MycoBank
- Zoobank
- The World Flora Online

All taxonomic entries in the above databases have been aggregated, so every single species and subspecies that figure in one of the databases are included. It has been deduplicated, so every word appears only once. The result is a dictionary consisting of around 1,4 million taxonomic words.
