### installation:
Install the Mozilla Firefox addon [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/the-taxonomy-dictionary/).

After installation you need to enable the dictionary.

As you can see, without enabling the dictionary the spelling engine have no good guess at what I was trying to write.

The Taxonomy Dictionary is labeled as Latin, so to enable it right click, then hover over "Languages" and click on "Latin".

Now Firefox will spell check all taxa at the same time as it spellchecks the rest of your writing.
